			 swiQlisp â€” site-wide Quicklisp
			 ==============================

Tools for installing Quicklisp site-wide and then managing that installation
(using a lisp implementation of your choice).

Works by creating an unprivileged system user 'swiqlisp' whose home directory is
in a site-wide location (default /usr/share/common-lisp/swiqlisp) and then
running lisp as that system user.  Symbolic links pointing to system definition
files are gathered together under a single directory; ~swiqlisp/installed-systems/.

Unprivileged users can then use ASDF:LOAD-SYSTEM to load these site-wide
installed Quicklisp libraries by simply adding ~swiqlisp/installed-systems/ to
their ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*.  To assist with this last step, the system
administrator is asked whether or not she would like to add a stanza to the
site-wide lisp initialisation file to this effect when installing swiqlisp.

Default lisp: sbcl


TODO
----

 - Invocations for lisps other than SBCL.

 - Site-wide SLIME?

 - Work out why, with a fresh swiqlisp, 'install' hunchentoot says that "30
   newly installed systems are now availiable" but if you then run 'systems'
   you'll see that 35 systems are in fact installed.


Debian package considerations
-----------------------------
 - Interactively generate /etc/swiqlisp.rc

 - Do the work of swiqlisp-install and swiqlisp-uninstall by package scripts

 - /usr/sbin/swiqlisp

 - Where does swiqlisp.lisp go?
