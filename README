			 swiQlisp — site-wide Quicklisp
			 ==============================

Tools for installing Quicklisp site-wide and then managing that installation
(using a lisp implementation of your choice).

Works by creating an unprivileged system user 'swiqlisp' whose home directory is
in a site-wide location (default /usr/share/common-lisp/swiqlisp) and then
running lisp as that system user.  Symbolic links pointing to system definition
files are gathered together under a single directory; ~swiqlisp/installed-systems/.

Unprivileged users can then use ASDF:LOAD-SYSTEM to load these site-wide
installed Quicklisp libraries by simply adding ~swiqlisp/installed-systems/ to
their ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*.  To assist with this last step, the system
administrator is asked whether or not she would like to add a stanza to the
site-wide lisp initialisation file to this effect when installing swiqlisp.


INSTALL
-------

 $ sudo ./swiqlisp-install


USAGE
-----

 $ [sudo] swiqlisp <query-or-action> [<system>] [<lisp>]

 (Queries do not require root privileges.  Actions do.)

Queries implemented so far:

 releases
 systems
 release-systems
 depends
 system-apropos

Actions implemented so far:

 install
 install-no-compile
 uninstall
 update-systems
 self-update
 refresh-system-links

Default lisp: sbcl


TODO
----
 • Fix non-privileged queries.

 • Write post-installation message about using swiQlisp SLIME.

 • Work out precisely why, with a fresh swiqlisp, 'install' hunchentoot says
   that "30 newly installed systems are now availiable" but if you then run
   'systems' you'll see that 35 systems are in fact installed.

 • Invocations for lisps other than SBCL.

 • Package collections.
