There's no facility to run swiQlisp from the source directory, i.e. from here.

Implementing such a facility is non-trivial since it means the main script
(swiqlisp) must be able to detect whether it was run as ./swiqlisp or as
/bin/swiqlisp and then alter it's behaviour accordingly.

For now therefore, whenever you change something here, the simplest way to test
your change is to copy the altered source file to its installation location
(overwriting the existing file in the process).

You can of course run the uninstallation script (swiqlisp-uninstall) and then
run the installation script (swiqlisp-install) each time you change something
(and this is obviously the way to test either or both of these two scripts) but
the uninstallation script removes the whole ~swiqlisp/ directory, including
Quicklisp itself and all installed systems, so this may not be what you want.

Alternatively, you may find it easier to edit certain installed files in-situ
and then copy them here if/when you want to permanently incorporate your changes
in the source.  This usually means not having to issue so many copy commands but
installed files aren't under version control so that's something to bear in
mind.

If all you want to do is turn debugging on or off, it's definitely simplest to
edit /etc/swiqlisp.rc in-situ rather than here.

To play with a SLIME-enabled swiQlisp SBCL:

 $ cd ~swiqlisp
 $ su -c "sbcl --no-sysinit --no-userinit --no-inform --load quicklisp/setup --load swiqlisp --eval '(asdf:load-system :swank)' --eval '(swank:create-server :port 50000)'" swiqlisp

You can then connect like so:

 (slime-connect "127.0.0.1" "50000")
