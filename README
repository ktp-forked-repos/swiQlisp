			 swiQlisp â€” site-wide Quicklisp
			 ==============================

Tools for installing Quicklisp site-wide and then managing that installation
(using lisp implementation of choice).

Works by creating a system user 'swiqlisp' whose home directory is in a
site-wide location (currently /usr/share/common-lisp/swiqlisp) and then running
lisp as that system user. Symbolic links pointing to system definition files are
then created under a single directory; ~swiqlisp/installed-systems/.

Unprivileged users can then use ASDF:LOAD-SYSTEM to load these site-wide
installed Quicklisp libraries by simply adding ~swiqlisp/installed-systems/ to
their ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*.


INSTALL
-------

 $ sudo ./swiqlisp-install


USAGE
-----

 $ sudo ./swiqlisp <action> [<project-or-system>] [<lisp>]

Actions implemented so far:

 projects systems install-{project|system} system-apropos

Default lisp: sbcl


TODO
----

 - A configure script for setting swiqlisp home directory location & generating
   a runtime configuration file (which should include: choice of lisp... and
   what else?)

 - As well as installing Quicklisp under ~swiqlisp, swiqlisp-install should put:

    swiqlisp      under /usr/sbin/
    swiqlisp.rc   under /etc/

 - Actually implement remove-{project|system}.

 - Provide an uninstallation script; swiqlisp-uninstall.

 - Should swiqlisp-install also add the ASDF stanza to /etc/sbclrc? Debian's sbcl
   uses /etc/sbcl.rc.  What about other lisps?

 - Invocations for lisps other than sbcl.

 - New commands: update-dist, update-client (is self-update a better name?)
                 init-file-stanza

 - Site-wide SLIME?
