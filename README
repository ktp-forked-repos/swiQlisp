			 swiQlisp â€” site-wide Quicklisp
			 ==============================

Tools for installing Quicklisp site-wide and then managing that installation
(using a lisp implementation of your choice).

Works by creating an unprivileged system user 'swiqlisp' whose home directory is
in a site-wide location (default /usr/share/common-lisp/swiqlisp) and then
running lisp as that system user.  Symbolic links pointing to system definition
files are gathered together under a single directory; ~swiqlisp/installed-systems/.

Unprivileged users can then use ASDF:LOAD-SYSTEM to load these site-wide
installed Quicklisp libraries by simply adding ~swiqlisp/installed-systems/ to
their ASDF:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*.  To assist with this last step, the system
administrator is asked whether or not she would like to add a stanza to the
site-wide lisp initialisation file to this effect when installing swiqlisp.


INSTALL
-------

 $ sudo ./swiqlisp-install


USAGE
-----

 $ sudo ./swiqlisp <query-or-action> [<system>] [<lisp>]

Queries implemented so far:

 releases systems release-systems system-apropos

Actions implemented so far:

 install install-no-compile uninstall self-update refresh-system-links

Default lisp: sbcl


TODO
----

 - A configure script for generating a swiqlisp.rc

 - As well as installing Quicklisp under ~swiqlisp, swiqlisp-install should put:

    swiqlisp      under /usr/sbin/
    swiqlisp.rc   under /etc/

 - Invocations for lisps other than sbcl.

 - Site-wide SLIME?

 - Modify ask () so that it presents a default answer (capitalised).
